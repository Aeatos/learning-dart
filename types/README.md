# Considerations and learning
Variables can be infered by the `var` keyword or by using their type in the beginning, like

```dart
var aString = "a string" // infers type by value
String anotherString = "another string" // you set the type by yourself
```

To break a line in text, I learned that I need to use "\n" without using quotes.
