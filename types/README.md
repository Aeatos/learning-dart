# Considerations and learning
Variables can be infered by the `var` keyword or by using their type in the beginning, like

```dart
var aString = "a string" // infers type by value
String anotherString = "another string" // you set the type by yourself
```
Always use void main (){"code here"} to run a dart aplication.

To break a line in text, I learned that I need to use "\n" without using quotes.

Generics are the type used on the code and they're used like this "<String>" for string, but it can be "<int>", "<Widget>" and so on. It just set the type of your list, your list is a generic class, so you can set for whatever type you'd like.
